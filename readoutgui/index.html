    <h1>GET Data source parameter help</h1>
    
    <h2>Host parameters</h2>
    <p>
        GET electronics requires an spdaq with a private subnet.  The private
        subnet connects to the GET micro-TCA crate.  This means that this
        spdaq has a pair of IP addresses, one which presents itself to the
        global data acquisition network (this IP is associated with an spdaq name
        e.g. spdaq08) and an IP address on that private subnet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The assumption, when starting is that the getEccServer is running,
        and that GetController will set up the connection between data
        received from a specific CoBo to the specified data router.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore the following host parameters are needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>spdaq</b> - The DNS name of the GET spdaq on the daq network.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>getEccServer</b> The ip address and service the getEccServer
            listens to for connections.  The IP address should be the address
            of the spdaq system on the local 10Gbit subnet.
            Normally the service number will be 46002
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Data router control</b> The ip addresss and service the
            nscldatarouter program will listen on for control connections.
            The IP address normally should be the address of the spdaq system
            on the local 10Gbit subnet.  The service number is normally  46003
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Data Router data</b>  The IP address and service the
                nscldatarouter program will listen on for data connnections.
                The IP address normally should be the address of the spdaq system
            on the local 10Gbit subnet.  The service number is normally  46005
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>CoBo target service</b> this is the IP address of the
                CoBo board from which we're going to get data along with the
                service on which it listens for data connections.  The
                IP address will depend on the board (see the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf)
                file in the spdaq for a list of possible CoBos.  The
                service number should nomrally be 46001
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ring buffer parameters.</h2>
    <p>
        GET electronics does not output start/stop items.  Therefore, three
        ringbuffers are used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>data-ring</b> - The data router inserts data from the GET electronics
                into this ring
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>transition-ring</b> - The data router inserts BEGIN_RUN and
                END_RUN state transition items into this ring.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>output-ring</b> - data from transition-ring and data-ring are merged
                into this output-ring and this is the ring from which
                data should be consumed by NSCLDAQ bits and pieces.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Miscellaneous parameters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>tssource</b>  Since we are not sure if we can do make GET
                synchronize its timestamp and/or clock with an external source,
                the system has the option of filling in event timestamps either from
                the GET timestamp or the GET trigger id (event number).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>source-id</b> provides the source id in body headers emitted by
                the system.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

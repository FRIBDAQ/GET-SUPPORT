    <h1>GET Data source parameter help</h1>
    
    <h2>Host parameters</h2>
    <p>
        GET electronics requires an spdaq with a private subnet.  The private
        subnet connects to the GET micro-TCA crate.  This means that this
        spdaq has a pair of IP addresses, one which presents itself to the
        global data acquisition network (this IP is associated with an spdaq name
        e.g. spdaq08) and an IP address on that private subnet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The assumption, when starting is that the getEccServer is running,
        and that GetController will set up the connection between data
        received from a specific CoBo to the specified data router.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore the following host parameters are needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>spdaq</b> - The DNS name of the GET spdaq on the daq network.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>getIP</b> - The private IP of the spdaq on the GET netework.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ring buffer parameters.</h2>
    <p>
        GET electronics does not output start/stop items.  Therefore, three
        ringbuffers are used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>data-ring</b> - The data router inserts data from the GET electronics
                into this ring
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>transition-ring</b> - The data router inserts BEGIN_RUN and
                END_RUN state transition items into this ring.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>output-ring</b> - data from transition-ring and data-ring are merged
                into this output-ring and this is the ring from which
                data should be consumed by NSCLDAQ bits and pieces.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Miscellaneous parameters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>tssource</b>  Since we are not sure if we can do make GET
                synchronize its timestamp and/or clock with an external source,
                the system has the option of filling in event timestamps either from
                the GET timestamp or the GET trigger id (event number).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>source-id</b> provides the source id in body headers emitted by
                the system.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
